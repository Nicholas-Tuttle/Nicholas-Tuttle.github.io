				Hello! My name is Nicholas Tuttle.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				I am currently working as a software development supervisor at <a href="https://www.osii.com">Open Systems International Inc.</a> (OSII), a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.aspentech.com/en">AspenTech</a>.
				I have 7 direct reports, and over the summer of 2023 we also have an intern.
				We work within a larger SCADA (supervisory control and data aquisition) team that creates processes for monitoring and controlling critical infrastructure.
				Our work is mainly focused on electrical grids across the world, but also includes water, gas, and other utilities.
				Since we deploy mission-critical software we have rigorous processes for ensuring availability, stability and performance.
				This includes automated workflows, such as unit testing, integration testing, and static code analysis. It also includes manual testing and QA. 
				My team designs, implements, and tests new SCADA services that customers interact with on a daily basis. 
				Other teams also interact with out services, so we maintain external interfaces that can be used to build more advanced applications.

				In my free time I enjoy learning about graphics programming, and have been familiarizing myself with the Vulkan API.
				I also enjoy creating digital art, I have a small portfolio on my Artstation profile <a href="https://www.artstation.com/thekingtut">here</a>.
				I especially love creating 3d renders of space, including planets, stars, and nebula.

				Here's one of my favorite renders of a science-fiction character that I created, and a space nebula as well:
